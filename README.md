## Simple Port Scanner

Welcome to my Simple Port Scanner project! üöÄ

### Overview
This lightweight Python script is a basic port scanner designed to help you explore and analyze open ports on a target system. Port scanning is a fundamental technique in network reconnaissance, allowing you to identify services running on specific ports and assess potential vulnerabilities.

### Features
- **Customizable Port Range:** Specify a range of ports to scan based on your requirements.
- **Quick Analysis:** Swiftly discover open ports on a target system to inform further investigation.

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script, providing the target IP address and desired port range as parameters.
   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py 
   ```
3. Analyze the results to identify open ports and potential services.

### Disclaimer
This tool is intended for educational purposes and should be used responsibly and with appropriate authorization. Ensure you have the right to scan the target system before initiating any port scanning activities.

Feel free to customize and contribute to enhance its functionality!

Happy scanning! üåêüîç
